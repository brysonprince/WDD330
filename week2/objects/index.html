    <h1>Objects</h1>
    <h2>Object literals</h2>
    <p>
      Objects map to any JavaScript value such as strings, numbers, booleans,
      arrays and functions. If a propertyâ€™s value is a function, it is known as
      a method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects can be created two ways: const myVar = {} (object literal) or
      const myVar = new Object() (constructor function)
    </p>
    <p>
      Javascript tries to add two different data types if it can convert them, but this doesn't always work. 
      AVOID IT

    <p>"Falsy" values: "", '', ``, 0, -0, NaN, false, null, undefined</p>
    <p>Don't forget about the "delete" operator (deletes an item in an array BUT replaces it with undefined, does not make array shorter)</p>
    <p>"shift()" is "pop()" for the beginning of the array "unshift()" is "push()" for the beginning of the array</p>
    <p>See console for code examples.</p>
